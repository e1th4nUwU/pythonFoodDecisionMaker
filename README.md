## How does it work ❓
Although it may seem that you are just selecting checkboxes in order to recommend which food to give you, the
program actually takes into account the selection you make up until you click the "Obtener recomendacioń" button,
 then, a random food according to your needs is selected and shown on screen as well as in the command line.
 
 ## Command line version
 Originally, this project was made to work on the command line rather than using a GUI. I decided to keep the code
 but comment it in case you want to learn a bit about the Pandas Python library; which is a Python data analysis
 and manipulation tool.
